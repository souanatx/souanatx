## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ana, a newbie in the world of coding and started my journey last year. Currently, I'm studying cybersecurity and network administration at CESAE. I'm passionate about web programming and have a few repositories showcasing my work from a web programming course.

I don't have much experience yet, but I'm eager to learn and contribute more to the coding community.
